VLM.run API Key Issue Analysis and Solutions

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- API key is valid for basic operations (health check returns 200 OK)
- API key fails for file upload operations (403 Forbidden on /v1/files?purpose=assistants)
- This suggests the API key has limited permissions or is from a restricted tier

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
1. Free tier API key without file processing permissions
2. API key requires account verification or payment setup
3. API key permissions don't include 'assistants' purpose uploads
4. Account status issue on VLM.run platform

IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:

1. Check VLM.run Dashboard:
   - Log into https://vlm.run/dashboard
   - Verify account status and tier
   - Check API key permissions and limits
   - Look for any pending verifications or billing issues

2. Alternative API Key Generation:
   - Try generating a new API key with full permissions
   - Check if there are different API key types (basic vs premium)

3. Contact VLM.run Support:
   - The API key works for health checks but not file uploads
   - This indicates a permission/tier issue rather than an invalid key

4. Temporary Workaround:
   - Continue using mock data until API access is resolved
   - The rest of the system (database, chat, frontend) works perfectly

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Error: [status=403] Invalid API Key
- Endpoint: https://api.vlm.run/v1/files?purpose=assistants
- Health endpoint works: https://api.vlm.run/v1/health returns 200 OK
- VLM client initializes successfully
